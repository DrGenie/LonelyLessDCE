          <h2>What this tool does</h2>
          <p>
            The tool brings together discrete choice experiment results, cost data and health outcomes to give
            a coherent picture of an intervention's financial viability and social value. It is designed for
            health departments, primary health networks, local governments and community organisations that are
            planning or scaling loneliness interventions for older adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            It helps answer questions such as whether older adults are likely to join a particular program,
            which features matter most to them, and how much impact in health and economic terms can be
            expected relative to the costs. Users can configure program features, see projected uptake,
            estimate willingness to pay based benefits and quantify cost savings and return on investment.

            <h3>Evidence base</h3>
            <p>
              The tool combines a discrete choice experiment on loneliness support programs with Australian cost
              effectiveness work on older adult loneliness interventions and recent evidence on the economic cost
              of loneliness and health service use. Detailed sources and assumptions are documented in the
              technical appendix.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Loneliness among older adults in Australia has measurable health and economic consequences.
            Evidence suggests that lonely older adults have higher risks of depression, dementia, stroke
            and early mortality, and that loneliness is associated with greater use of health care and
            productivity losses. At population level, the economic cost of loneliness in Australia has
            been estimated in the billions of dollars per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community based programs that support social connection can reduce loneliness and help prevent
            depression. Modelled evaluations for older Australians find that such interventions can produce
            positive returns on investment when health care cost savings and productivity gains are included.
            For example, one national scale educational friendship program for older women showed that for
            each dollar invested, savings of more than two dollars were projected over five years, together
            with millions of loneliness free days gained.
          </p>
          <p>
            This decision aid uses discrete choice experiment estimates to predict programme uptake and
            willingness to pay, and links these to realistic cost components and health outcomes. It aims
            to support transparent discussion between policy analysts, clinicians and community partners
            about which program configurations are most attractive and where investments may yield the
            greatest value.

Welcome to the LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid.

This tool is designed to help policy makers and planners think clearly about investments in programs that reduce loneliness among older adults in Australia.

On the top of the screen, you can see several tabs. These take you from understanding the evidence through to configuring a program and interpreting the results.

The Attributes tab explains the core features that older adults told us they care about. These include the type of support program, whether the program is delivered in person, virtually or as a hybrid, how often sessions occur, how long they last and how close to home they are. It also includes the out-of-pocket cost per session.

The Configuration tab is where you build a scenario. Start by giving your scenario a clear name and short notes so that you can recognise it later. Then select the levels for each attribute that match the program you have in mind. You can also choose whether to include the opportunity cost of participants time in the cost calculations.

When you click Apply configuration, the tool translates your choices into a predicted uptake rate using results from a discrete choice experiment with older Australians. It also calculates the number of participants, expected costs and several benefit measures.

The WTP outcomes tab shows the estimated willingness to pay for the configuration. This reflects how much people value the program features in monetary terms, based on the trade-offs they made in the study.

The Programme uptake tab shows a simple chart of the predicted share of older adults who would join the program versus those who would not, along with a text recommendation about how to improve uptake if needed.

The Costs and benefits tab brings together economic information. It reports total economic cost, cost per participant, monetised QALY gains, cost savings and productivity gains, as well as loneliness free days and benefit cost ratios based on different benefit measures.

The Saved scenarios tab lets you store and compare several configurations, and export a summary to PDF for use in slide decks, briefs and business cases.

Throughout the tool, you can open the technical appendix for a transparent description of data sources, assumptions and methods. We encourage you to treat this decision aid as a starting point for discussion and refinement, adapted to local data and policy priorities.

Thank you for using the LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid.

              <p>
                QALY gains are based on modelled reductions in loneliness and depression among older adults.
                The tool multiplies QALY gain per participant by the number of participants and a monetary
                value per QALY, which is configurable in the technical appendix.

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-stethoscope"></i> Cost savings and productivity gains</h4>
              <p>
                Health system cost savings and productivity gains are based on Australian modelling of a
                national friendship enrichment program for older women, which reported healthcare and
                productivity savings over three and five year time horizons. The tool scales these per
                participant savings to the configured cohort size.

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-sun"></i> Loneliness free days</h4>
              <p>
                Loneliness free days are an interpretable outcome that captures the number of days during
                which participants are expected not to experience loneliness. The tool uses estimates from
                Australian modelling that reported millions of loneliness free days gained over five years,
                and applies a per participant figure to the configured cohort.

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> WTP based benefits</h4>
              <p>
                Willingness to pay based benefits are derived directly from the discrete choice experiment
                by summing attribute specific willingness to pay estimates for the configuration and
                multiplying by sessions and participants. This provides a preference based measure of
                programme value that is distinct from QALY and cost saving metrics.
