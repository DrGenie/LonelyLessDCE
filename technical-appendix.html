    <h1>LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid Tool<br />Technical Appendix</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This appendix documents the methods, assumptions and evidence sources used in the LonelyLessAustralia
        decision aid tool. It explains how discrete choice experiment results are translated into predicted
        uptake and willingness to pay, how cost components and health outcomes are parameterised for the
        Australian context and how benefit cost metrics and return on investment are derived.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main manuscript describes the development of the discrete choice experiment, the survey sample
        and headline model results for older adults in Australia. A separate online appendix provides a
        narrative walk through of the public web based LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid and illustrates
        how policy makers can configure and compare scenarios. The present technical appendix should be
        read alongside the main manuscript and the online appendix. References to the decision aid in
        the main text and online appendix point to the same public link where the tool is hosted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Discrete choice experiment and uptake model</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Attributes and design</h3>
      <p>
        The discrete choice experiment (DCE) elicited preferences for key features of loneliness support
        programmes for older adults. Attributes included the type of support programme, delivery mode,
        frequency of sessions, duration of sessions, travel distance to the venue and out of pocket cost
        per session. Attribute levels were selected through a targeted review of the literature on
        loneliness interventions, consultation with clinical and policy stakeholders and qualitative
        pre testing with older adults, in line with recommended good practice for health related DCEs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each attribute, one level was treated as the reference and additional levels represented
        improvements or trade offs. Respondents aged 65 years and older completed a series of paired
        choice tasks in which they chose between two hypothetical programmes and an opt out option of
        not joining any programme. The experimental design used a blocked D efficient design, with
        respondents randomly allocated to blocks. The design was optimised around priors from a pilot
        study and checked for level balance and overlap. A dual response option structure for the opt
        out alternative was considered at the design stage and is described in the main manuscript.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Econometric model</h3>
      <p>
        The primary DCE analysis estimated an error component logit model with a random alternative
        specific constant (ASC) for the programme options to capture panel correlation and unobserved
        preference heterogeneity, while treating non cost attributes as fixed. The utility for
        individual <em>n</em> choosing alternative <em>j</em> in choice situation <em>t</em> is written as
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>U<sub>njt</sub> = V<sub>njt</sub> + ε<sub>njt</sub></em>,
        where the observed component of utility for the programme option is
        <em>V<sub>program</sub> = ASC<sub>program</sub> + βX − β<sub>c</sub>Cost</em>
        and for the opt out alternative
        <em>V<sub>optout</sub> = ASC<sub>optout</sub></em>. Here <em>X</em> is a vector of coded attribute
        levels and <em>Cost</em> is the out of pocket cost per session. The cost coefficient
        <em>β<sub>c</sub></em> is constrained to be negative and is treated as continuous.
      </p>
      <p>
        For implementation in the LonelyLessAustralia tool, a parsimonious mixed logit specification is
        used. The ASC for opting into any programme is modelled with a normal random coefficient, while
        attribute coefficients are treated as fixed and equal to the preferred error component logit
        estimates. This allows the tool to approximate preference heterogeneity through the ASC while
        keeping computations fast enough for real time interaction. The model structure and estimation
        approach follow standard texts on stated choice modelling and applied guidance for health DCEs.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Predicted uptake</h3>
      <p>
        For any given configuration of attribute levels, the tool constructs the deterministic utility
        index for the programme alternative by inserting the coded attributes and cost into the model
        coefficients. Predicted uptake is then obtained using the standard logit formula for the
        choice between joining the programme and opting out. The probability of joining the programme
        is
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>P(programme) = exp(V<sub>program</sub>) / [exp(V<sub>program</sub>) + exp(V<sub>optout</sub>)]</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This probability is interpreted as the expected uptake proportion among eligible older adults,
        holding constant the distribution of preferences implicit in the DCE sample. In the decision
        aid, a base cohort size of 250 eligible older adults is assumed. The expected number of
        participants is calculated as this cohort size multiplied by the predicted uptake probability.
        Users can rescale the results to other cohort sizes through linear extrapolation. The main
        manuscript reports the underlying model estimates and discusses the face validity of uptake
        predictions, while the online appendix illustrates how users can read the uptake charts in
        the programme uptake tab of the tool.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Willingness to pay and preference based benefits</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Attribute level willingness to pay</h3>
      <p>
        Willingness to pay (WTP) for each attribute level is obtained from the DCE model by dividing the
        attribute coefficient by the absolute value of the cost coefficient. For attribute <em>k</em> with
        coefficient <em>β<sub>k</sub></em> and cost coefficient <em>β<sub>c</sub></em>, the implied marginal
        WTP is
        <em>WTP<sub>k</sub> = β<sub>k</sub> / |β<sub>c</sub>|</em>. This yields a monetary value in Australian
        dollars per session that represents the additional fee older adults would be willing to pay for
        a change from the reference level of that attribute, holding other attributes constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WTP outcomes tab in the tool presents point estimates of WTP per participant per session for
        each attribute level. These values are obtained from the main mixed logit model used for the
        tool and are rounded for display. Where available, standard errors and p values associated with
        WTP are derived using the delta method from the estimated variance covariance matrix of the DCE
        regression. Methods for deriving WTP from DCEs and interpreting the resulting trade offs are
        consistent with established guidance on stated preference methods in health and patient centred
        outcomes research.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 WTP for a configuration</h3>
      <p>
        For any specific programme configuration, the tool calculates the per participant WTP per
        session by summing the attribute level WTP values corresponding to the selected levels. For
        example, if the configuration involves a group based community engagement programme delivered
        in person at a local venue, meeting weekly for ninety minutes at a given co payment, the WTP
        contribution for each of these design features is summed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The per participant WTP for the complete programme is then obtained by multiplying the per
        session WTP by the number of sessions. The current implementation assumes twelve sessions by
        default, which aligns with the group based educational friendship enrichment intervention used
        in Australian modelling of loneliness interventions for older women. Total WTP based benefits
        for the scenario are calculated by multiplying the programme level WTP by the expected number
        of participants predicted by the uptake model.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WTP based benefit cost ratio is defined as the ratio of total WTP benefits to total economic
        costs. Values greater than one indicate that, on average, the stated value that older adults
        place on the configured programme features exceeds the estimated economic cost of delivering
        the programme to the target group. The main manuscript reports headline WTP patterns, while
        the online appendix shows example WTP summaries for several illustrative configurations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Costing of interventions</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Base cost structure</h3>
      <p>
        Cost components and unit values in the decision aid are based on Australian costing work for
        loneliness interventions, particularly the modelling of the Friendship Enrichment Programme and
        volunteer led internet and computer training interventions for older women. These interventions
        were evaluated using a Markov model that reported programme costs, healthcare savings, productivity
        gains and return on investment over three and five year horizons. The National Mental Health
        Commission also developed a technical brief and workbook that set out detailed assumptions for
        intervention delivery and resource use. These sources provide the conceptual template for the
        LonelyLessAustralia cost structure, which is adapted to a local cohort of 250 eligible older
        adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        Table 1 summarises the main cost components in the tool, together with the unit cost, quantity
        assumptions and principal evidence sources or justification. All costs are expressed in 2024
        Australian dollars. Where necessary, costs were updated from published values using Australian
        consumer price index data and average weekly earnings to approximate wage growth for relevant
        staff categories.

      </table>

      <h3>4.2 Total economic cost</h3>
      <p>
        The decision aid separates fixed costs that do not vary with uptake from variable costs that depend
        on the number of participants and sessions. Fixed costs include local advertising, programme setup,
        development of materials and a portion of administrative time. Variable costs include venue hire,
        facilitator time, session materials and participant travel. When the user indicates that the
        opportunity cost of participant time should be included, time spent in sessions and travel is
        monetised using the hourly rate in Table 1 and added to variable costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a chosen configuration, total economic cost is calculated as the sum of fixed costs plus the
        number of sessions multiplied by the per session variable cost per participant and the predicted
        number of participants. When users change the number of sessions, delivery mode or co payment,
        these changes propagate automatically through the costing engine. The costs and benefits tab of
        the tool displays total economic cost, cost per participant and cost per loneliness free day
        alongside the benefits described in later sections.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Cost of living adjustments</h3>
      <p>
        The tool allows the user to apply optional state or territory specific multipliers to reflect
        differences in cost of living and service delivery costs across Australia. These multipliers are
        applied to both programme costs and participant fees. The default values are illustrative and
        were calibrated using publicly available data on relative wage levels and consumer prices across
        jurisdictions. Users with access to more precise local cost information can adjust these
        multipliers to better reflect their context and can then save configurations for later use.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Health outcomes and QALY gains</h2>
      <p>
        The link between loneliness interventions and health outcomes in the decision aid is based on
        modelled cost effectiveness work evaluating the impact of group based loneliness interventions
        on depression and associated health states among older adults in Australia. In this work,
        reducing loneliness through preventive programmes led to gains in quality adjusted life years
        by lowering the incidence of depression and other adverse health outcomes over time. The analysis
        reported incremental cost effectiveness ratios for the Friendship Enrichment Programme and a
        volunteer led internet and computer training intervention, as well as estimates of cost savings
        and return on investment over five years.
      </p>
      <p>
        To translate these findings into a flexible decision aid, the tool allows users to select low,
        moderate and high QALY gain scenarios per participant. These values are calibrated so that the
        implied cost per QALY gained and cost per loneliness free year fall within the range reported in
        the published model for base case scenarios. The default monetary value per QALY is set at fifty
        thousand Australian dollars, which is consistent with values commonly used in Australian cost
        effectiveness analyses and international health technology assessment guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Total QALY based benefits for a configuration are calculated as the product of the QALY gain per
        participant, the predicted number of participants and the value per QALY. The QALY based benefit
        cost ratio is obtained by dividing total QALY benefits by total economic costs. Both the benefits
        and the ratio are reported in the costs and benefits tab and are used to construct example
        scenarios discussed in the main manuscript and online appendix.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Cost savings, productivity gains and loneliness free days</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Cost savings and productivity gains</h3>
      <p>
        Loneliness is associated with greater use of primary care and hospital services, higher demand
        for mental health care and increased workplace absenteeism and presenteeism among working age
        older adults. Australian analyses of the economic costs of loneliness have shown that the total
        cost across the adult population is substantial, running into billions of dollars per year, with
        older adults accounting for a sizable share of healthcare and productivity costs. These findings
        are consistent with international reviews that highlight loneliness and social isolation as
        important determinants of health care use and economic outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LonelyLessAustralia tool parameterises cost savings and productivity gains using per
        participant values derived from the National Mental Health Commission modelling of friendship
        enrichment and internet training interventions for older women. In that work, national rollout
        of the programmes was estimated to generate healthcare savings and productivity gains that
        exceeded the intervention costs, with a return of around two to three dollars in savings for
        each dollar invested over five years for some scenarios. By dividing the reported aggregate
        healthcare savings and productivity gains by the number of programme participants in that
        modelling, the decision aid derives per participant savings over five years and scales these to
        the predicted number of participants in each configured scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        Total cost savings and productivity gains for a given configuration are therefore calculated as
        the per participant savings multiplied by the expected number of participants. These totals are
        displayed in the costs and benefits tab and are used to calculate a cost saving based benefit
        cost ratio, defined as the ratio of five year savings to the total economic cost of delivering
        the configured programme.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Loneliness free days</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to monetary outcomes, the National Mental Health Commission modelling reported
        loneliness free days as a primary outcome of the friendship enrichment programme. Over three
        and five year horizons, the interventions were estimated to generate several million additional
        days in which participants were not lonely, relative to a comparator of no intervention. These
        loneliness free days can be interpreted as a patient relevant benefit that is closely aligned
        with the goals of the intervention and is easy to communicate to non technical audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision aid converts the published loneliness free day totals into a per participant value
        over five years by dividing by the number of participants in the modelled cohort. This per
        participant figure is then multiplied by the predicted number of participants for the configured
        programme, assuming proportional scaling. The result is an estimate of total loneliness free
        days attributable to the programme over five years. This metric is reported alongside QALY
        gains and monetary outcomes to give users a direct sense of improvements in experienced
        loneliness over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Benefit cost ratios and return on investment</h2>
      <p>
        For each scenario, the decision aid reports several benefit cost ratios and associated net benefit
        measures. First, a QALY based benefit cost ratio is defined as monetised QALY benefits divided
        by total economic costs, with the corresponding net benefit equal to QALY benefits minus costs.
        Second, a cost savings based benefit cost ratio is calculated as the ratio of total health system
        and productivity savings over five years to total economic costs, with net benefit given by total
        savings minus costs. Third, a willingness to pay based benefit cost ratio is obtained by dividing
        total WTP benefits by total economic costs, with net benefit equal to WTP benefits minus costs.
        These three summary indicators offer complementary perspectives on value: health outcome gains,
        fiscal and productivity savings and user centred valuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Commission modelling that underpins the calibration of the tool, the ratio of total cost
        savings and productivity gains to programme costs corresponds to a conventional return on
        investment measure. In that analysis, the base case return on investment over five years was
        reported to be greater than two for some intervention scenarios, meaning that each dollar spent
        generated more than two dollars in savings. The LonelyLessAustralia tool adopts the same
        interpretation when reporting cost savings based benefit cost ratios and uses parameter values
        that preserve this broad order of magnitude for illustrative scenarios.

        Users should bear in mind that the underlying estimates are based on specific interventions,
        populations and time horizons. When applying results to new settings, it is important to
        consider differences in programme design, baseline loneliness, comorbidities, service
        availability and health system structures. The main manuscript highlights these limitations
        and cautions against treating the benefit cost ratios as definitive decision rules. The tool
        is intended to support structured dialogue and scenario analysis rather than to replace
        formal business case development.

      <h2>8. Illustrative scenarios and model outputs</h2>
      <p>
        To demonstrate how the decision aid combines preferences, costs and benefits, the online
        appendix and main manuscript describe several illustrative programme configurations. These
        scenarios vary programme type, delivery mode, travel distance and co payment while keeping
        other parameters at their default values. Table 2 reports example outputs for three such
        scenarios using a base cohort of 250 eligible older adults, the default moderate QALY gain
        setting and inclusion of participant time costs.

        These outputs are illustrative and are intended to show the relative rather than absolute
        differences between scenarios. Scenario C, which offers more intensive in person support
        with convenient access, generates higher predicted uptake and larger QALY and loneliness free
        day gains, at the expense of higher total economic cost. Scenario B has lower cost but also
        lower uptake and smaller benefits. The pattern of benefit cost ratios reflects this trade off
        between intensity and scale. Users can construct and save alternative configurations in the
        tool and export the summary results to inform local decision making or business case
        development.

      <h2>9. Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The decision aid relies on several simplifying assumptions that are important to acknowledge.
        The DCE model represents average preferences across older adults in the sample and does not
        explicitly model preference heterogeneity by subgroups such as sex, cultural background,
        income or region, although the random ASC captures some unobserved heterogeneity. Cost
        parameters and savings estimates are drawn from specific interventions and time periods and
        may not fully reflect current wage rates, service configurations or policy priorities in all
        jurisdictions. QALY gains and loneliness free days are represented by scenario values that are
        calibrated to the published modelling rather than by intervention specific estimates for every
        possible programme design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the tool is best used as a structured scenario generator that supports comparative
        analysis, stakeholder engagement and clear communication of trade offs. It should not be used
        as a stand alone decision rule. Formal funding decisions and detailed business cases should be
        supported by context specific economic evaluations that use up to date local data and explore
        uncertainty more fully, including sensitivity analyses around key parameters. The main
        manuscript discusses these limitations and highlights directions for future refinement of the
        model, including incorporation of subgroup specific preference and outcome data as they become
        available.
