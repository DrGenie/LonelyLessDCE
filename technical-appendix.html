    <h1>LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid Tool<br />Technical Appendix</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This appendix documents the methods, assumptions and evidence sources used in the LonelyLessAustralia
        decision aid tool. It explains how discrete choice experiment results are translated into predicted
        uptake and willingness to pay, how cost components and health outcomes are parameterised for the
        Australian context and how benefit cost metrics and return on investment are derived.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Discrete choice experiment and uptake model</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Attributes and design</h3>
      <p>
        The discrete choice experiment (DCE) included attributes that describe key features of loneliness
        support programs for older adults: type of support programme, delivery method, frequency and
        duration of sessions, accessibility and participant cost per session. For each attribute, one level
        was treated as the reference and additional levels represented improvements or trade offs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respondents aged 65 years and older were asked to choose between hypothetical programmes and an
        opt out option in a series of choice tasks. The design followed standard practice in health
        economics, with blocked experimental designs and a dual response structure where appropriate.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Econometric model</h3>
      <p>
        The main analysis estimated an error component logit model with a random alternative specific
        constant for the programme options to capture panel correlation and unobserved preference
        heterogeneity, with all non cost attributes treated as fixed effects. For use in the tool, a
        parsimonious mixed logit specification with normally distributed random part of the alternative
        specific constant and a continuous cost coefficient was implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The utility for the programme alternative is specified as a linear index in the coded attributes
        and continuous cost, with an alternative specific constant for opting into any programme versus
        the opt out choice. Coefficient values used in the interface correspond to the main model
        estimates from the DCE analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Predicted uptake</h3>
      <p>
        For a given configuration of attributes, the tool constructs the utility index and applies the
        standard logit formula to estimate the probability that a representative older adult chooses the
        programme instead of the opt out option. This probability is interpreted as the expected uptake
        proportion in a target population of eligible older adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base cohort size in the tool is set to 250 eligible older adults. The number of participants
        is obtained by multiplying this cohort by the predicted uptake probability. Users can rescale
        results to alternative cohort sizes by linear extrapolation, as the model is formulated per
        eligible individual.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Willingness to pay and preference based benefits</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Attribute level willingness to pay</h3>
      <p>
        Willingness to pay (WTP) for each attribute level is obtained by dividing the attribute coefficient
        by the absolute value of the cost coefficient from the DCE model. This yields a monetary value in
        Australian dollars representing the extra fee per session that older adults would be willing to pay
        for that feature relative to the reference level, holding other attributes constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool uses point estimates of WTP per participant per session for each attribute level. Standard
        errors and p values reported in the WTP tab are derived from the variance covariance matrix of the
        estimated coefficients in the DCE regression models.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 WTP for a configuration</h3>
      <p>
        For any given configuration, the tool computes the per participant WTP per session by summing the
        relevant attribute level WTP estimates. For example, if the configuration combines a community
        engagement programme with weekly sessions, a local venue and a virtual delivery method, the
        corresponding WTP values for those four attributes are added together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The per participant WTP for the entire programme is then calculated by multiplying the per session
        WTP by the number of sessions. In the current implementation, twelve sessions are assumed, which
        aligns with the group based intervention used in Australian modelling of loneliness interventions
        for older women. The total WTP based benefit for the configuration is obtained by multiplying the
        per participant programme WTP by the number of participants predicted to enrol.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WTP based benefit cost ratio is calculated as the ratio of total WTP benefits to total economic
        costs. This ratio provides a preference based indicator of value, grounded in older adults stated
        willingness to pay for programme features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Costing of interventions</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Base cost structure</h3>
      <p>
        Cost components and unit values in the tool are based on Australian costing work for loneliness
        interventions. The structure follows the educational friendship enrichment programme for older
        women described by the National Mental Health Commission, which reports intervention costs, cost
        savings and return on investment for a national implementation of a group based programme over
        three and five year horizons. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost items include advertising in local press, printing and postage of leaflets, administrative
        staff time, trainer time, on costs, facilitator salaries, materials, venue hire, participant time
        cost and travel. Unit costs and quantities reflect those reported in the commission's technical
        brief and related cost effectiveness work on reducing loneliness to prevent depression among older
        adults. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Total economic cost</h3>
      <p>
        In the decision aid, fixed costs include advertising and a set of overheads that do not vary with
        achieved uptake. Variable costs scale with the proportion of the cohort that takes up the
        programme. For example, printing, postage and many session level costs are multiplied by the
        predicted uptake probability to reflect the smaller or larger number of participants reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        When users choose to include opportunity cost of participants time, the tool adds a monetised value
        of time spent in sessions and travel. This is calculated by multiplying session and travel hours
        per participant by an hourly value of time based on a fraction of average hourly wages for older
        adults, consistent with the treatment of time and travel costs in scenario analyses reported by
        the National Mental Health Commission. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Cost of living adjustments</h3>
      <p>
        The optional cost of living adjustment applies a state specific multiplier to programme costs and
        participant fees. The multipliers are illustrative and based on relative differences in cost of
        living and service costs across Australian jurisdictions as reported in public data sources and
        wage statistics. Users can revise these multipliers if more precise local information is available.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Health outcomes and QALY gains</h2>
      <p>
        The link between loneliness interventions and health outcomes in the tool is based on modelled
        cost effectiveness work which examined the impact of reducing loneliness on depression in older
        adults in Australia. In that analysis, reducing loneliness through a preventive programme led to
        gains in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) by lowering the incidence of depression and its
        sequelae. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision aid allows users to choose from low, moderate and high QALY gain scenarios per
        participant. These values are intended to span plausible effect sizes rather than to represent
        precise estimates for any specific intervention. The default monetary value per QALY is set at
        fifty thousand Australian dollars, which is within the range used in Australian cost effectiveness
        analyses and international guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Total QALY benefits for a configuration are calculated as the QALY gain per participant multiplied
        by the predicted number of participants and by the value per QALY. The QALY based benefit cost
        ratio is then obtained by dividing total QALY benefits by total economic costs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Cost savings, productivity gains and loneliness free days</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Cost savings and productivity gains</h3>
      <p>
        Evidence suggests that loneliness is associated with greater use of primary care, hospital services
        and mental health care, as well as increased sick leave and reduced productivity. An Australian
        analysis estimated that the total cost of loneliness across the adult population can reach several
        billion dollars per year, with older adults accounting for a substantial share of this cost. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool parameterises cost savings and productivity gains using per participant values drawn from
        the National Mental Health Commission's educational friendship programme modelling. That work
        reported total intervention costs of about twenty five million dollars, healthcare savings of over
        twenty five million dollars and productivity gains of more than forty six million dollars over five
        years for a national cohort of older women, producing a positive return on investment. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
      </p>
      <p>
        By dividing the reported cost savings and productivity gains by the number of programme
        participants, the tool derives per participant savings over five years and scales these to the
        predicted number of participants in each configuration. The resulting totals are used to compute
        a cost saving based benefit cost ratio.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Loneliness free days</h3>
      <p>
        The National Mental Health Commission modelling also reported loneliness free days as a primary
        outcome, with several million loneliness free days gained over three years and more than eighteen
        million over five years for the national cohort of older women. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision aid converts these findings into a per participant estimate of loneliness free days
        over five years and multiplies by the predicted number of participants for the configured
        programme. This produces a simple, intuitive metric that reflects improvements in experienced
        loneliness over time, independent of monetary valuation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Benefit cost ratios and return on investment</h2>
      <p>
        For each scenario, the tool reports several benefit cost ratios and associated net benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A QALY based benefit cost ratio, defined as monetised QALY benefits divided by total economic
          costs, together with the net benefit equal to QALY benefits minus costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          A cost saving based benefit cost ratio, defined as total health system and productivity savings
          over five years divided by total economic costs, with the corresponding net benefit equal to
          savings minus costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          A willingness to pay based benefit cost ratio, defined as total WTP benefits divided by total
          economic costs, with net benefit equal to WTP benefits minus costs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ratio of total cost savings and productivity gains to intervention costs in the commission's
        modelling represents a conventional return on investment metric. In that analysis, the return on
        investment over five years was greater than two for the base case scenario, meaning that each dollar
        spent generated more than two dollars in savings. The decision aid adopts the same interpretation
        when reporting cost saving based benefit cost ratios. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
      </p>
      <p>
        Users should bear in mind that the underlying estimates are based on specific interventions,
        populations and time horizons. When applying results to new settings, it is important to consider
        differences in programme design, baseline loneliness, comorbidities and health system structures.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Suggested additional benefit measures</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the metrics already implemented in the tool, decision makers may wish to incorporate
        additional benefit measures depending on data availability and policy priorities. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Carer outcomes, such as reduced caregiver burden and improved quality of life for family members,
          which may be relevant when programmes support socially isolated older adults with care needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Long term impacts on dementia risk, cardiovascular disease and mortality, given evidence that
          loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher risks of these outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
        </li>
        <li>
          Wider social benefits, such as increased volunteering, community participation and strengthened
          social capital, which may contribute to more resilient communities and indirect economic gains.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Incorporating these outcomes would require additional modelling and evidence synthesis and is beyond
        the scope of the current version of the tool.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>9. Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The decision aid relies on several simplifying assumptions. The DCE model represents average
        preferences across older adults and may not capture all important sources of heterogeneity. Cost
        parameters and savings estimates come from specific programmes and time periods and may not fully
        reflect current wage rates, service costs or policy settings. QALY gains are represented by
        scenario values rather than intervention specific estimates within the tool, although the default
        values are grounded in the literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the tool is best used to support comparative scenario analysis and structured
        discussion rather than as a stand alone decision rule. Formal business cases and funding decisions
        should still be based on context specific analyses using up to date local data.
